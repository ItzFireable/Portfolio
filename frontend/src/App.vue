    <ProjectBanner title="Untitled C++ based rhythm game" banner="urg.gif" direction="left"
      link_desc="View the source code on GitHub" link="https://github.com/ItzFireable/cpp-rhythm-game"
      description="A project made for Tredu in 2022-2023. Made using SDL2 and SDL_GPU, made in approximately 2-3 months without any prior experience in C++. The game is a rhythm game, where the player has to hit the correct notes at the correct time as accurately as possible to get as much score as possible. I did not have a lot of time to implement all the features I wanted, but I am still proud of the result. The project is also well optimized, although for some reason struggles on NVIDIA GPUs due to the graphics rendering library used." />

      link="https://www.roblox.com/games/13042495892/Project-Afternight"
      description="This is another Roblox game I worked on, which was also based on Friday Night Funkin'. It was also a port of Friday Night Funkin', but properly managed and not a super messy codebase. The project had a non-profit approach, and expanded to other genres, including a lot of popular musicians within the game. I was one of the owners, and a lead developer, managing backend code, designing UI and logo and managed the project until start of 2025. It is still in active development by another team." />

      link="https://www.roblox.com/games/7603193259/Friday-Night-Bloxxin"
      description="This is a Roblox game I worked on due to my previous interest in Friday Night Funkin'. This game was a port of the game onto Roblox, including most of the popular mods created at the time. It is also a rhythm game, just like all of these other projects. I was a lead developer and project manager on this game throughout 2022-2023. Since then this project has since been canceled and superseded by the next project on this page." />

      description="This is a mod made for an indie rhythm game Friday Night Funkin'. It features music from the Japanese musician Camellia / Cametek, which consists primarily of speedcore / hardcore genre. The project was made using a platform called Kade Engine, which was the popular tool at the time. I was the lead developer and main programmer of this project until update 2 in 2022, and left the team afterwards. It is currently being maintained by another team." />
