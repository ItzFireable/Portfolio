# Portfolio
This is the source code for the portfolio shown on the fireable.me website. It has been rewritten using Vite + Vue for frontend and ElysiaJS for the backend, both using TypeScript.

### Backend
You need an environment file to run the backend, as it depends on Spotify and Discord integration.

Run the commands to launch the backend
```
cd backend
bun run ./src/index.ts
```

### Frontend
Run the commands to launch the frontend
```
cd frontend
bun run dev
```
